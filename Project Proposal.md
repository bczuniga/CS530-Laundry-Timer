# CS 530 Project Proposal
**Brendel Zuniga, Brylle Isaiah Villoso**

## Project Description
### Initiative, Background, Motivationâ€¦
- Sometimes we forget about our laundry because we want to optimize our time. So we often turn our attention to other tasks which may take up more time than the laundry timer. We also realize that some people may not be able to afford smart laundry machines so we can offer assistance into allowing those laundry machines to work similarly to smart laundry machines by making this project.

### Objective
- We want to make an affordable conversion of a non-smart washing machine into a smart washing machine using an Arduino. 

### Breakdown of functions
[UML Diagram/Flow Chart](/UML%20Diagram.md)

### Competitor products, if there are any
- There are a few products out there that can accomplish the same outcome of receiving a notification when your laundry is done. For example, any Samsung washing machine or dryer that is "Samsung SmartThings" enabled, allowing someone to use their app to receive notifications whenever their  laundry is done.

## Project Management:
- Breakdown/Distribution of tasks
    - [Design, Implementation, Testing](https://trello.com/invite/b/3cojUJlh/ATTI8e29e608ab0c6605c77fc9270a2ed50962869D3A/cs-530-laundry-timer)
- Project timeline/milestones
    - [ ] Getting first prototype being that the system integration between hardware and software works
    - [ ] Getting the main function of our system to work, i.e. getting any output from our system
    - [ ] Setting up Discord integration to allow for Discord notifications via webhooks
    - [ ] Edge-case testing (false alarms, power outages, ideal conditions)
    - [ ] \(Optional) Feature creep
- Current progress
    - [X] Buy the hardware
    - [X] Setup development environment
    - [X] Install necessary software
    - [ ] Draft UML diagrams and flowchart
    - [ ] Refine UML diagrams and flowchart
    - *Add more as necessary*
